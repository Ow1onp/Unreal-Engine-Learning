# C ++ foundation: C ++ advanced grammar and characteristics

## 1.stl Introduction

### 1.1 What is STL

Standard Template Library (STL) is an important part of the C ++ standard library. It provides a universal, reusable, template -based component for data storage and operation.STL consists of containers, iterators, algorithms, and function objects. It aims to let programmers write universal code in an efficient and concise way.



### 1.2 STL component part

- ** container (containers) **: The collection of objects for storing and managing data.The container provides the implementation of various data structures, such as array, linked lists, trees, hash tables.
- ** Iterators (Iterators) **: A unified way is provided to traverse the elements in the container.The iterator is similar to the pointer and supports the access and operation of the container element.
- ** algorithm (algorithms) **: A set of common algorithm functions to operate data in the container, such as sorting, searching, copying, modifying, etc.
- ** Function Objects **: Also known as an imitation function, an object of a similar function can be passed as a parameter in the algorithm.
- ** adapters **: The interfaces used to modify the container, iterators, or function objects to meet different needs.



### 1.3 STL advantage

- ** Efficiency **: The algorithms and containers in STL have been carefully designed and optimized to provide efficient performance.
- ** Universal **: Based on the template mechanism, STL can be suitable for various data types and data structures.
- ** Repeatability **: STL provides a large number of ready -made components, reducing the need for repeated wheels.
- ** Readability and maintenance playability **: The code using STL is simpler and easier to read, which helps improve the quality of code.



## 2. Common container

STL provides a variety of containers to meet different application needs.It is mainly divided into sequential containers and associated containers.
